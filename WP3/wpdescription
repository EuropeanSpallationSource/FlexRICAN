Solar, bio gas and wind power generation can help power RI’s. Since RI’s occupy substantial real estate, significant power can be generated by using the areas on the RI. The WP will study how solar power can be implemented and how much power can be generated in different configurations. This can then be applied to a RI if you know the geometry and the meteorological data. Cooling the solar panels can improve the efficiency of a solar power installation, and this will be studied in a sub-WP. In another sub-WP alternative energy sources, like bio-gas turbines will be considered to back up the local grid. The use of solar power can be combined with use of batteries (WP 4) to increase flexibility and together provide a more reliable grid environment.
