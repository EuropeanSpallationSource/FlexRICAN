The consortium includes RIs that have different energy management needs and thus cross-sectionally represent a broad implementation range within the RIs. For ELI the main carbon footprint comes from maintaining the indoor environment of the building (air controlled condition and services to lasers) as for EMFL comes from the research instruments themselves (the high field magnets).
This WP aims at creating common tools to implement the results from WP6 and at the same time to cover the different needs for carbon footprint reduction arising from the multi-platform representation of RIs in the consortium. This will expand the applicability of the outputs from the whole project.
The validated results of the implementation of the Tasks on the already operating ELI and EMFL facilities will then be used to optimize the ESS commissioning (2025-2026), which brings together the needs from all 3 Tasks.
