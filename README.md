FLEXIBILITY IN RIs FOR GLOBAL CARBON NEUTRALITY
The FlexRICAN project unites three ESFRI infrastructures, three academic institutions and two industrial partners from Europe to bring sustainable solutions to large research infrastructures.

FlexRICAN will demonstrate how research infrastructures as electro-intensive actors can enhance energy flexibility for the European electrical grid and contribute to local heating networks through Waste Heat Recovery projects.

All data and software packages generated within the project is deployed to this repository.
