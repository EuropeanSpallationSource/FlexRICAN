The objectives of the WP:
-	to modelize the multi-energy potential of flexibility of the 3 RIs involved in the project and to quantify the benefit in terms of carbon print and services rendered to networks of different scales from the European Grid through to the local heating network.
-	to spread the methods and modelization developed in this project towards other RI.
